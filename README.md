Silent Bell

A lightweight meditation timer with built in log. No accounts, no tracking, no ads.

  - 225KB – loads instantly, works offline
  - Private log – your sessions stay on your device
  - PWA-ready – install on phone or desktop
  - Open source (MIT)

  How to use
  
Set the time and hit start. After the session, details are automatically saved to your log. Add a note afterward if you like, or log sessions you did without the app.
In settings, adjust default duration, sound, interval bells, preparation countdown, and toggle notes on or off.
In iOS do not manually turn off the screen - it will prevent the sound from ringing at the end of session.

  Installation 
  
Option 1: Use in browser (quickest)

Open https://jwaseon.netlify.app/ in any modern browser and start meditating immediately. No installation required.

Option 2: Install as app (recommended)

Silent Bell works as a Progressive Web App—install it once, use it anytime, even offline.

 a) iPhone/iPad (Safari):
      -  Open the site in Safari
      -  Tap the Share button (rectangle with arrow)
      -  Scroll down and tap "Add to Home Screen"
      -  Tap "Add"
 b) Android (Chrome):
      -  Open the site in Chrome
      -  Tap the menu (three dots) or look for the install prompt
      -  Tap "Install" or "Add to Home Screen"

Once installed, Silent Bell launches like any native app - no browser, no address bar, just the timer.
