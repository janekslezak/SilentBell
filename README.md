Simple meditation timer with locally stored log, can be used as PWA.

Work in progress - now mostly vibe-coded with Claude.

For everything to work properly, you need to add to the main folder:

1) NoSleep.min.js from: 
https://github.com/richtr/NoSleep.js/blob/master/dist/NoSleep.min.js
2) 'bell.mp3' file with desired bell sound
3) Icon files, respectively 'icon-192.png' & 'icon-512.png' (192x192 & 512x512)
